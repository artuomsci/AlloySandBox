I find Plant UML to be an amazing tool that I use regularly. However, one aspect of UML that I find lacking is the formalism. I have been experimenting with the Alloy modeling language for some time, and I find it very promising. Currently, I am considering the idea of writing a Python script to convert Alloy code into Plant UML, with a main focus on structural class diagrams. The key concepts in structural diagrams are composition and aggregation, which are particularly challenging to handle due to the multiple ways they can be represented in Alloy. For now, I have decided to represent all relationships as "owning".
